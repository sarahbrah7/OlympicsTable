# OlympicsTable
Year 1 Procedural Programming Mini Project

This is my mini project which simulates an Olympics medal table, the user can choose which countries and sports the medals are being won for. The user can also choose the amount of countries whihc will be on the board, and then set before hand the amount of medals, then for each sports event there will be a random number generator picking whether the country has won a medal, and which one. Furthermore, the program will write this onto a txt file.
